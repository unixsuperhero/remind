HTML Hebrew Calendar Server

This is a rudimentary Hebrew calendar server for the WWW.  It
supplies local sunrise and sunset times, moon phases, upcoming Jewish
holidays, and PostScript calendars.  It only works under UNIX.  I've
only tested it with Linux running NCSA's httpd and Apache's httpd, but
it should work on any UNIX web server.

To install it, you need the Remind package, available via ftp from
ftp://ftp.doe.carleton.ca/pub/remind-3.0.  You should install Remind,
setting the lattitude, longitude, location and time zone as appropriate
for your machine.

Once you have Remind installed, follow these steps to set up your WWW
server:

1) Edit the Makefile in this directory.  See the comments in the Makefile
   for details.

2) Edit the first line of "rem2html" to reflect the location of
   Perl on your system. (Oh yeah, you need Perl for the
   HTML Hebrew calendar...)

3) Type "make install"

4) Test it out.  It will generate links of the form:

	http://www.your_server.com/your_cgi-bin/cal_dispatch?what

where "what" is one of:
	sunrise -- show info about sunrise times.
	sunset  -- show info about sunset times.
	hebdate -- show today's Hebrew date.
	calps   -- get a blank PostScript calendar.
	moon    -- show info about moon phases.
	hebps   -- get a PostScript calendar with Jewish holidays.
	hebhtml -- get an HTML version of the above (requires Perl.)

   (Visit http://www.doe.carleton.ca/~dfs/ for previews.)

   All of these links will be set up in a sample HTML document
   called "calendar.html" and installed in the HTMLDIR you specified
   in the Makefile.

4) Enjoy!
