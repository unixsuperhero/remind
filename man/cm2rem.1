cm2rem.tcl \- Convert Sun's "cm" input file to Remind format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cm2rem.tcl < cm_file > remind_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcm2rem.tcl\fR reads the Sun calendar manager data file and converts
it into a \fBRemind\fR script.  Note that \fBcm2rem.tcl\fR can convert
\fIonly\fR version 3 calendar manager files.  If you are using version 4
files, there should be a system utility to convert them to version 3 files.

.SH BUGS
Not all of the Sun calendar manager options are respected.  In particular,
nothing is done for e-mail actions.  Also, the resulting Remind script
is not editable with \fBTkRemind\fR; you can only edit it with a text
editor.

\fBcm2rem.tcl\fR requires Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or higher.  The
\fBtclsh\fR interpreter must be on your \fBpath\fR.
