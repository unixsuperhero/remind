MICROSOFT WINDOWS
=================

I used to prohibit porting Remind to Microsoft Windows.  However, this
may cause problems with the GPL, so I have removed that restriction.

Although I cannot prevent you from porting Remind to Windows, I appeal
to you not to do it.  I am trying to encourage the growth of free
software, not proprietary software.

If you port Remind to Windows, I will not provide support or answers to
questions -- you're on your own.  On the other hand, I will feel no guilt
in taking enhancements and merging them into the UNIX stream.

APPLE
=====

I can't prevent you from using Remind on Apple's products, but I hope
you don't.  Apple's corporate culture is the very antithesis of Free
Software.  Rather than using Mac OS X, I encourage you to switch to
Linux or FreeBSD, two Free Software operating systems that are every
bit as capable as Mac OS X and which are unencumbered by Apple's
arbitrary restrictions.

And if you're looking to port Remind to other Apple products like the
iPhone or iPad, please don't.  Those products enforce Apple's rigorous
controls much more stringently than Mac OS X on an Apple PC.
